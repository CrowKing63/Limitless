## Design Philosophy

These assets were created with the following principles in mind:

1. **Representation** - Showcasing people with disabilities in a positive light
2. **Education** - Highlighting common accessibility barriers
3. **Empowerment** - Framing the gameplay around overcoming barriers rather than violence
4. **Inclusion** - Ensuring the visual design is accessible to players with different abilities
5. **Awareness** - Using gameplay to raise awareness about accessibility issues

The assets use high contrast colors and clear shapes to ensure visibility for players with visual impairments, and the sound design avoids frequencies that might be problematic for players with hearing sensitivities.
